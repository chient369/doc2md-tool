## ðŸ“Œ Document Search & Retrieval Rules

### 1. Initial Scan (`metadata.md`)
- Read the `./doc_base/metadata.md` file located in the root directory.
- Identify and list all available documents along with their descriptions, categories, or tags.

### 2. File Relevance Evaluation
- Based on metadata information (e.g., file titles, tags, descriptions), determine which documents are most likely to contain the target information.
- Rank the documents by relevance if multiple candidates exist.

### 3. Fallback to Keyword Search
- If no relevant files are found in `metadata.md`, perform a keyword search inside the `./doc_base` directory.
- Prioritize documents where:
  - Keywords appear in **headings**, metadata, or titles.
  - Keywords match **exactly** (not partially).

### 4. No Results Handling
- If **no relevant information** is found after both metadata review and keyword search:
  - Clearly inform the user that the data was not found.
  - Suggest possible next actions (e.g., adjust keywords, check document structure, consult domain experts).

### 5. Content Extraction & Presentation
- Extract only the **relevant parts** of the document that answer the userâ€™s query.
- Do not return the full document unless explicitly requested.

### 6. Multi-Source Aggregation
- If the answer spans multiple documents:
  - Aggregate and **summarize the content** into a unified response.
  - Ensure **no contradictions**.
  - Prioritize:
    - Newer documents
    - Primary sources mentioned in `metadata.md`

### 7. File Path Disclosure
- Always return the **full file path(s)** to every document used in the response.
